# Digidexplus

A Flutter based Digimon encyclopedia

This project is an open source digimon encyclopedia. The app consumes the various API's in the https://digimon-api.com/ arsenal to display a list of digimon and the details of each. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to practice "best practices" with regards to building an app. so we're talking about things like: 

- unit testing
- bloc/provider design patterns
- separation of concerns
- dependency injection etc

Though the API is not extensive i believe this is a project that can incorporate various ideas and as such it would be great to have anyone interested in getting involved in improving the app to participate and contribute.

## Notes
You may notice that the list of digimon is made possible with a class called the StackedListView, its important to note that all credits go to <> for this listview, unfortunately i couldn't use the lib because it has a bug that affected the listing of items. 
so i copied the code and fixed it myself. i'll be creating a pull request to fix the bug soon.

## Download
The app will also be available soon on the Google playstore
